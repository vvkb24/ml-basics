## Pending Tasks (To Do)
1. **Churn Case Study Notebooks**
   - [ ] `01_eda.ipynb`: Exploratory analysis with reasoning.
   - [ ] `02_modeling.ipynb`: Model training with decision checkpoints.
   - [ ] `03_evaluation.ipynb`: Metrics and business impact.

2. **Next Guides**
   - [ ] Transformers Deep Guide (`08_frameworks/transformers/transformers_deep_guide.md`)
   - [ ] Library Comparison: Pandas vs NumPy (`01_docs/library_comparisons/pandas_vs_numpy.md`)

3. **Future Case Studies**
   - [ ] Time Series Forecasting (Stock prices)
   - [ ] Text Classification (Sentiment analysis)

## Notes for Next Session
- Continue with `01_eda.ipynb` in `12_experiments/churn_prediction/`.
- Ensure data path is correct: `data/telco_churn.csv`.
- Focus on "decision checkpoints" in notebooks.
