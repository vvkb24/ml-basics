# LSTM and GRU

> **Status:** Stub - Implementation coming soon

## Overview

Gated architectures that solve the vanishing gradient problem.

## LSTM

### Gates
- **Forget gate:** What to discard from cell state
- **Input gate:** What new info to store
- **Output gate:** What to output

### Cell State
Allows gradients to flow unchanged.

## GRU

Simplified variant with:
- **Reset gate**
- **Update gate**
